# What is a PGDKP???
A Performance Gold Dragon Kill Points (PGDKP) is a GDKP raid that pays participants according to performance in the raid measured by damage and healing output.

## Ok but what's a GDKP raid?
A Gold Dragon Kill Points (GDKP) raid is a raid that offers participants an opportunity to be paid according to a pot. A pot, or the amount of gold spent by raiders for gear, is proportional to the quality of the gear that is available within the raid.
At the end of the raid, all members are expected to be paid out in accordance to a publicized payout structure. Some members are denied pay due to gameplay incompetencies as part of a social expectation.

## Performance Metric Flaws
The performance metrics which this payout structure is based on is flawed. It's accepted that Damage and healing alone do not entirely comprise a player's contribution to their raid.
To address this, arbitrary bonuses are recorded so that the user can address any payout inequalities perceived.
